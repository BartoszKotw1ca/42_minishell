1. Add libft to the project.
2. Learn how branches works.
3. Read about functions:
readline, rl_clear_history, rl_on_new_line,
rl_replace_line, rl_redisplay, add_history,
printf, malloc, free, write, access, open, read,
close, fork, wait, waitpid, wait3, wait4, signal,
sigaction, sigemptyset, sigaddset, kill, exit,
getcwd, chdir, stat, lstat, fstat, unlink, execve,
dup, dup2, pipe, opendir, readdir, closedir,
strerror, perror, isatty, ttyname, ttyslot, ioctl,
getenv, tcsetattr, tcgetattr, tgetent, tgetflag,
tgetnum, tgetstr, tgoto, tputs
4. Import pipex. 
5. Make Makefile(pipex, libft); 
6. 

1. I added to main Makefile two makfiles:
	-Janek 
	-Bartek
	We have to chose which one is better
4. We imported pipex, but its not a libray so it
 should be compiling normally, not like a libray.
 5. I did Makefile, but like i said and there was a problem
  with read_file.c.
